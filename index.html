                    This is a cute, nostalgic toy of my friend, Nikki. She said its a right-facing Dragon Basket. At first, I thought this object is ‘a dragon laying in a basket’, but after carefully reading through the description Nikki wrote, I realized that this object is a dragon-like basket. I have no idea about what this object was like, so I tried to follow the instructions and did everything I could do, to make it as lovely as possible.</p>

                   The form I chose is quite simple and easy for me to understand. I discovered many interesting ways, such as using both the mouse and key to interact with the face and also adding typography to it. I think it is very important to understand the logic while typing the code, things could only be runned when every part of the code is resonable and correct.<br> Try clicking the mouse & SPACE bar.

                    This is an abstract representation of time, inspired by the Chinese idiom “Dripping water wears through stone.” It conveys the concepts of time, effort, and patience. The idea of perseverance is well-expressed, encouraging people by illustrating this natural phenomenon. Similarly, a person who keeps working hard and putting in continuous effort will eventually succeed.

                    This is a fun group work assignment—like a chemical reaction, where unexpected new things emerge during the process. While creating it, I found that the curve was the most challenging part to make. The character Ding is formed by Lia’s balloon-human Bobby’s leg combined with Milly’s baby-octopus’ body.

                    While sketching dafts, I wanted to use simple, clear code to create something really cute and satisfying. I got inspired from a kind of material named "double-sided sequin fabric," which can be reversible/flipped and create a different color effect.

                    This records my frequency of cooking at home during Nov. 2024. After collecting the data, I realized that my frequency of cooking is directly associated with my class schedule- if I have too much class during a day (such as Thursday), I would grab some snacks to eat instead of spending time cooking.

                    This autobiographical game is inspired by my experience as an international student. Before coming to the U.S., I heard many negative portrayals, but living here showed me they were exaggerated. Like the mouse in this story, I learned that reality is often more nuanced. Embracing open-mindedness will guide you to true growth.
